Hello, Iâ€™m Samagra, the founder of [Tensorfuse](https://www.tensorfuse.io), a YC startup focused on making AI experimentation easier and more scalable. With a Computer Science background from IIT Roorkee, I've spent my career developing and improving technology infrastructures at Adobe Research, UCSB Systems and Networking Lab, and Aerotime.

Aside from my professional work, I have a strong interest in mathematics, reading, and the classical language of Sanskrit, which provide both mental stimulation and cultural enrichment. As a devout Hindu, I draw inspiration and guidance from the stories of Hanuman and Krishna, whose tales of strength and wisdom form the foundation of my beliefs.

During my free time, I relish the strategic challenges of chess, keep active at the gym, and pursue my love for cooking, particularly traditional Indian cuisine. Through my blog, I share insights from the tech industry, talk about my hobbies, and explore how technology intersects with daily life.

I am always open to meaningful discussions and potential partnerships. Whether you're keen on AI technologies or looking to swap recipes, feel free to reach out!
